# Java-Console-Calculator
Simple console-based calculator in Java

🎯 Objective

Build a simple console-based calculator using Java that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division through user input.

⚙️ Tools & Technologies

Language: Java (JDK 8 or higher)

IDE/Editor: Visual Studio Code / IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse (or any Java IDE)

Execution: Terminal / Command Prompt / IDE Run Console

📂 Deliverable

Source Code File: Calculator.java

🧠 Features & Requirements

Define separate methods for:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division

Use Scanner to take user input.

Implement a loop to perform multiple operations until the user chooses to exit.

Handle division by zero gracefully with a user-friendly message.

🧩 Program Flow
1. Display a menu:
   1. Addition
   2. Subtraction
   3. Multiplication
   4. Division
   5. Exit

2. Get the user’s choice.
3. Input two numbers.
4. Perform the selected operation.
5. Display the result.
6. Repeat until the user selects Exit.

💻 Sample Output
===== SIMPLE CALCULATOR =====
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Exit
Enter your choice: 1
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 25
Result: 35.0

===== SIMPLE CALCULATOR =====
